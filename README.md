# Storage-and-B--Plus-Tree-Indexing-of-Database-Management-System
The objective of this project is to implement following two components of a database management system, storage and indexing. For the storage component, a fraction of main memory is allocated to be used as disk storage. The disk storage is organised and accessed with a block as a unit. For the indexing component, a B+ tree is used and each node is stored in the memory region bounded by the block size. Some functions were also created to build the B+ tree, conduct search using the B+ tree, add to the B+ tree and deletion using B+ tree.
